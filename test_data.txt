Introduction
Every year on August 15, India commemorates its independence. The country was ruled by Britain for almost 200 years, eventually becoming independent and becoming an independent nation. August 15 has become a day of independence. It is also commemorated as a memorial to the freedom warriors who gave their lives to make the world a better place for us to live. It is celebrated with great enthusiasm and courage by all the citizens of India because Independence
Day means a lot to them and is very important.
Here’s how it is celebrated in schools, colleges and across the country and why it is important for
students and citizens of the country.
Celebration of Independence Day in School/ Colleges
As 15 August is a national holiday, Freedom Day celebrations are held yesterday in many schools and colleges across the country. Freedom Day celebrations in schools and colleges across the country include flag raising, speeches, debates and competitions, dances, repetition of poetry and various other cultural activities. Students are very excited about these activities and participate wholeheartedly in them. Students of the main league are also seen dressed as freedom fighters. These activities draw students closer to their roots and fill them with a sense of patriotism that is lacking in this generation.

Independence Day Celebration in Offices
This day is also celebrated in the offices the day before independence day.
In offices, employees are often asked to wear saffron, white or green clothing to match the theme of Freedom Day. People are seen wearing national costumes in the said colors and the whole
atmosphere is lit. Flag-raising is done at most offices around the country, with special lunch arrangements being made to strengthen the bond between staff. Sometimes, people also come to give talks and some offices organize cultural events to add to the feeling. Also, read the conclusion of the Independence Day article.

Independence Day Residence Celebration
Residential welfare organizations in various residential areas are taking the initiative to celebrate Independence Day these days. People gathered in a nearby park in the early hours of the morning on Independence Day to celebrate the day with its true meaning.
They dress according to the theme of Freedom Day and participate in various activities organized during the program, Raising the flag is done at the beginning of the ceremony.
After the flag was hoisted, the people stood in awe and paid homage to the national anthem.
Patriotic songs are fully played during the celebrations and people seem to be immersed in the spirit of nationalism. During these events, dance competitions and poetry competitions are organized.
Luxury dress competitions are also held, where children are considered to be freedom fighters such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Sarojini Naidu, Bhagat Singh, etc. These competitions are often followed by lunch. People stay together and enjoy a meal during these events, this is a great time to collaborate with the neighbors.

In many parts of our country, kite flying is practiced as a custom on Independence Day. Colorful kites flying freely in the sky are considered a sign of independence. People go to their terrace or go to the nearby ground to enjoy the work of a flying kite. They invited their friends and relatives to join in the celebration. Flying kite competitions are also held at various venues and people participate with great enthusiasm.
History of Independence Day
The story of India’s liberation is very long, with various freedom fighters fighting for their courage and tolerance. Meanwhile, European traders were increasingly seeking to settle in India and establish themselves on the Indian subcontinent. At the same time, in the Battle of Plessy in 1757 and the Battle of Buxar in 1764, India faced foreign forces, but India could not prove its strength and was defeated in these wars. Thereafter, the East India Company began to spread its influence in India and by the end of the 18th century, the British had established their monarchy in many parts of India.
At the same time, the company harassed Indian society by enacting a number of stricter laws in
India, as well as many oppressive policies that applied to the people. Because the Indians opposed the foreign emperor and created hatred for them. At the same time, it was because of these British oppressive policies that the 1857 uprising began from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh on May 10, 1857.

At the same time, the war of 1857 is considered India’s first liberation war. Also, read the conclusion of the Independence Day article. Major rebels such as Mangal Pandey, Tatya Tope, Rani Laxmi Bai, Nana Saheb, Begum Hazrat Mahal, Rani Avanti Bai and Babu Kunwar have played their key role in this war. At the same time, our country could not stand on its own two feet in this war, but this transformation had a profound effect on all Indians and aroused a desire for freedom within the Indians.

In line with this, after the war of 1857, the British rulers recognized the power of the Indians and
after this, the cruel and oppressive policies of the British East India Company began to weaken.
After the Revolt of 1857, the Indian state was taken over by the British East India Company in 1858 and handed over to the British Crown which is the British Monarchy.

At the end of the war of 1857, the liberation struggle spread to India and after that, the British felt that they could not rule India for long. At the same time, it rebelled after the civil war from 1885 to 1905, led by many major Indian revolutionaries, including India’s great freedom fighters Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Madan Mohan Malviya and Dadabhai Naoroji. All the reforms that led to this war were ideological and political, which fought for freedom peacefully.

By the 19th century, however, the atrocities perpetrated by the British on the Indian subcontinent had intensified. Because at the end of the 19th century Lala Lajpat Rai, Bipin Chandra Pal took many steps against the British and provoked the anger in the minds of the Indians against the British. Everyone united in seeking independence in India.
At the same time, as a result of the efforts of these freedom fighters, the British became afraid of
the Indians.

In the 19th century, several movements including the Non-Cooperation Movement, Civil
Disobedience Movement and the Quit India Movement, Mahatma Gandhi’s Nonviolent Movement shook the foundations of the British and Indian empires. The road to freedom was easy, and he left no choice but to leave India and the British. Meanwhile, in 1885, the Indian National Congress Party was formed. In 1929, the Indian National Congress demanded complete independence.
After that, freedom fighters, politicians and the Indian people united and strengthened their British rebellion against independence. As a result, the British Parliament ordered Lord Mount batten to rule in India until 30 June 1948, weakening the British Empire in India, but only then did the British see the flames and their level of intolerance within India. Lord Mountbatten decided to leave India in August 1947 before waiting for the deadline. The British, who had persecuted the Indians for so many years, sacrificed their lives in the face of the courage, courage and unity of the Indians. So on August 15, 1947, India became an independent nation.

Conclusion
August 15 is a day to celebrate freedom, and to remember the great souls who stood up for their
rights and fought no matter what their lives were.
This day is celebrated with great enthusiasm throughout the country; we hope you like the essay on Freedom Day


Technology growth in India after independence:
India is recognized globally for its scientific rigour and potential. After all, this is the land of Ayurveda, the land of climate sensitivity demonstrated through the Chipko Movement back in the 1970s, the land where successful nuclear tests like Pokhran-II were conducted, the land where science maestros C.V. Raman (Nobel Prize in Physics 1930) and Anna Mani were born. 

India was able to gain pace in scientific discovery only after independence. Getting back the reigns of democracy and planning the years ahead to regain our prosperity encouraged people to work towards scientific and technological advancements. In all these years, India witnessed a massive shift in these fields of discovery by strategically aligning its skills and resources.

Here’s looking back at the accomplishments of India in the field of science and technology post-independence, and the developments we are progressing towards

Establishment of a Five-Year plan which prioritized scientific research:

The Planning Commission in India was set up in 1950 with an aim to ideate and plan the actions to be taken in key sectors such as agriculture, science, infrastructure, and education. The first-ever plan draft was presented in July 1951 and had a dedicated chapter on ‘Scientific and Industrial Research’. Being the first plan, it prioritized laying the foundation of scientific research in the country and largely focused on initiatives for building or enhancing national laboratories and research centers:
It recognized eleven research institutes at the national level and stressed their importance in the development of the country’s future. These included the National Physical Laboratory of India (Delhi), National Chemical Laboratory (Pune, Maharashtra), and Central Electrochemical Research Institute (Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu) among others.
Some of these institutes only had nucleus units and needed more investment for their expansion. The plan provided for the completion of buildings and installation of the necessary equipment to enable the laboratories to function fully.
It also proposed the setting up of three new institutes: Radio and Electronics Research Institute; Mechanical Engineering Research Institute; Central Salt Research Station.



Aryabhata – India’s first satellite

India’s contribution to the science of space is immense. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) was established in 1969 to serve as India’s national space agency. The first-ever Indian satellite was the ‘Aryabhata’, which was designed and manufactured in India and was launched on 19th April 1975. ISRO developed Aryabhata to execute X-ray astronomy, aeronomy and solar physics.



AGNI – India’s strategic missile
India successfully developed strategic missile systems in the 1980s, with successful testing of Agni in 1989. Eventually Indian scientists were able to demonstrate abilities such as re-entry, maneuvering range, control, guidance, two-stage propulsion and stage separation. Since then, India has created, tested, operationalized several missile systems. The Agni became a series of missiles, with the latest one being Agni-V, successfully tested in 2018. 



DNA fingerprinting
DNA fingerprinting in India came into existence in 1988 when Council of Scientific and Industrial Research–Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CSIR–CCMB) scientists developed the technique and made it available for use, making India the third country to develop its own DNA fingerprinting probe.

Pokhran-II nuclear test
On 11th May 1998, India successfully tested five nuclear bombs underground in Pokhran, Rajasthan—these tests were titled ‘Pokhran-II’.

In order to facilitate the technological achievement of an emerging democracy, this day was named ‘National Technology Day’ by our then Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It is observed each year.   


Chandrayaan-I mission to the moon

Chandrayaan-I was India’s first-ever mission to the moon, launched on 22nd October 2008 from Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The spacecraft hovered around the moon to deliver chemical, photo geologic, and mineralogical mapping to ISRO.

COVID-19 vaccine research and vaccination drive

India was at the forefront of the vaccine development research, eventually becoming one of the largest manufacturers and exporters of COVID-19 vaccines. As of end-2021, we have supplied over 7 Crore COVID-19 vaccine doses to more than 90 countries.

Further, the scale of India’s vaccination drive has been unprecedented. As of February 2022, more than 170 crore vaccination doses have been administered.

As we continue to evolve and innovate, the aim is to maintain the pace of development in science and technology, along with ensuring global recognition and exposure.

Indian Scientists:
Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930 for his pioneering work on scattering of light. Born in Tiruchirapalli on November 7, 1888, he was the first Asian to receive any Nobel Prize in the sciences. Raman also worked on the acoustics of musical instruments. He was the first to investigate the harmonic nature of the sound of the Indian drums such as the tabla and the mridangam.

Through his discovery, he found that when light passes through a transparent material, a portion of the scattered light undergoes a shift in wavelength. This occurrence, now known as Raman scattering, is a direct outcome of the Raman effect.

In October 1970, he collapsed in his laboratory, leading to his transfer to a hospital where doctors predicted he had four hours left to live. However, he defied the odds and survived. After a few days, he chose to leave the hospital, opting to spend his final moments in the gardens of his Institute (the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore) surrounded by his beloved flowers. Chandrasekhara passed away due to natural causes on 21 November 1970.

Before dying, Raman told his students,

Do not allow the journals of the Academy to die, for they are the sensitive indicators of the quality of Science being done in the country and whether science is taking root in it or not.



Born on October 30, 1909 in Bombay, Homi Jehangir Bhabha played an important role in the Quantum Theory.

He was the first person to become the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India. Having started his scientific career in nuclear physics from Great Britain, Bhabha returned to India and played a key role in convincing the Congress Party’s senior leaders, most notably Jawaharlal Nehru, to start the ambitious nuclear programme.

Bhabha is generally acknowledged as the father of Indian nuclear power. But few people know that he was absolutely against India manufacturing atomic bombs, even if the country had enough resources to do so. Instead he suggested that the production of an atomic reactor should be used to lessen India’s misery and poverty.

Indian Scientist Bhabha died when Air India Flight 101 crashed near Mont Blanc on 24 January 1966. Many possible theories of the crash came up including a conspiracy theory in which the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is involved in order to paralyze India’s nuclear program.

Born on 15 September 1860, Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya was a notable Indian engineer, scholar, statesman and the Diwan of Mysore during 1912 to 1918. He was a recipient of the Indian Republic’s highest honour, the Bharat Ratna.

Sir M V suggested that India try to be at par with industrialized nations as he believed that India can become developed through industries.

He has the credit of inventing ‘automatic sluice gates’ and ‘block irrigation system’ which are still considered to be marvels in engineering. Each year, his birthday 15 September is celebrated as Engineer’s Day in India.

Since river beds were costly, he came up with an efficient way of filtering water through ‘Collector Wells’ in 1895 which was rarely seen anywhere in the world

Venkatraman Radhakrishnan was born on May 18, 1929 in Tondaripet, a suburb of Chennai. Venkataraman was a globally renowned space scientist and a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He was an internationally acclaimed Astrophysicist and also known for his design and fabrication of ultralight aircraft and sailboats.

His observations and theoretical insights helped the community in unraveling many mysteries surrounding pulsars, interstellar clouds, galaxy structures and various other celestial bodies. Indian Scientist Venkatraman died at the age of 81 in Bangalore.

Born on October 19, 1910 in Lahore, British India, he was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics for his mathematical theory of black holes. The Chandrasekhar limit is named after him. He was nephew of CV Raman. Chandra became a United States citizen in 1953.

His most celebrated work concerns the radiation of energy from stars, particularly white dwarf stars, which are the dying fragments of stars. He died on August 21, 1995, at the age of 82 in Chicago.

Born on January 1, 1894 in Calcutta, SN Bose was an Indian physicist specialising in quantum mechanics. He is of course most remembered for his role played in the class of particles ‘bosons‘, which were named after him by Paul Dirac to commemorate his work in the field.

Bose adapted a lecture at the University of Dhaka on the theory of radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe into a short article called “Planck’s Law and the Hypothesis of Light Quanta” and sent it to Albert Einstein. Einstein agreed with him, translated Bose’s paper “Planck’s Law and Hypothesis of Light Quanta” into German, and had it published in Zeitschrift für Physik under Bose’s name, in 1924. This formed the basis of the Bose-Einstein Statistics.

In 1937, Rabindranath Tagore dedicated his only book on science, Visva–Parichay, to Indian Scientist Satyendra Nath Bose. The Government of India awarded him India’s second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan in 1954.

Born on October 6, 1893 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Meghnad Saha’s best-known work concerned the thermal ionisation of elements, and it led him to formulate what is known as the Saha Equation. This equation is one of the basic tools for interpretation of the spectra of stars in astrophysics. By studying the spectra of various stars, one can find their temperature and from that, using Saha’s equation, determine the ionisation state of the various elements making up the star.

This Indian Scientist also invented an instrument to measure the weight and pressure of solar rays. But did you know, he was also the chief architect of river planning in India? He prepared the original plan for the Damodar Valley Project.

Born on December 22, 1887 in Tamil Nadu, Ramanujam was an Indian mathematician and autodidact who, with almost no formal training in pure mathematics, made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions.

By age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students who were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book on advanced trigonometry written by S. L. Loney. He completely mastered this book by the age of 13 and discovered sophisticated theorems on his own.

We hadn’t known before that he faced a lot of health problems while living in England due to scarcity of vegetarian food. He returned to India and died at a young age of 32.

Ramanujan’s home state of Tamil Nadu celebrates 22 December (Ramanujan’s birthday) as ‘State IT Day’, memorializing both the man and his achievements.

Acharya J.C. Bose was a man of many talents. Born on 30 November, 1858 in Bikrampur, West Bengal, he was a polymath, physicist, biologist, botanist and archaeologist. He pioneered the study of radio and microwave optics, made important contributions to the study of plants and laid the foundation of experimental science in the Indian sub-continent. He was the first person to use semiconductor junctions to detect radio signals, thus demonstrating wireless communication for the first time. What’s more, he is also probably the father of open technology, as he made his inventions and work freely available for others to further develop. His reluctance for patenting his work is legendary.

Another of his well known inventions is the crescograph, through which he measured plant response to various stimuli and hypothesized that plants can feel pain, understand affection etc.

While most of us are aware of his scientific prowess, we might not be aware of his talent as an early writer of science fiction! This Indian Scientist is in fact considered the father of Bengali science fiction.

Considered as the Father of India’s space programme, Vikram Sarabhai was born on on 12 August, 1919 in the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat. He was instrumental in the setting up of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), when he successfully convinced the Indian government of the importance of a space programme for a developing nation after the launch of the Russian Sputnik, in this quote:

There are some who question the relevance of space activities in a developing nation. To us, there is no ambiguity of purpose. We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically advanced nations in the exploration of the moon or the planets or manned space-flight.
But we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally, and in the community of nations, we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society.



He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1966 and the Padma Vubhushan after his death in 1972. While everyone knows of his primary role in the establishment of ISRO, perhaps many of us do not know that he was also the force behind the establishment of many other Indian institutes of repute, most notably the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) and the Nehru Foundation for Development.

Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, born on October 15, 1931 is an Indian scientist who worked as an Aerospace engineer with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

Kalam started his career by designing a small helicopter for the Indian Army. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) where he was the project director of India’s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near earth’s orbit in July 1980.

He also served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam advocated plans to develop India into a developed nation by 2020 in his book India 2020. He has received several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honour. Known for his love for children, did you know that Kalam had set a goal of meeting 100,000 students in the 2 years after his resignation from the role of scientific adviser in 1999? May he continue to inspire millions.
